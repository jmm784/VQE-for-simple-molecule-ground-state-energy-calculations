# VQE-for-simple-molecule-ground-state-energy-calculations
Repository description: Python function files and an interactive jupyter notebook demonstrating how VQE performs under 27 different combinations of mappers, ansatze, and optimisers for both noisy and noiseless simulations

This project was started as a Summer project to bridge the gap between my 2nd and 3rd year of Univeristy. In the provided interactive notebook, achieved ground state energies under noiseless and noisy simulations can be found, along with energy convergence plots, and classical values for comparison. Also included in the repository is a requirements.txt file should anyone wish to play around with this project locally (Python==3.10.8 was used). A brief project report can also be found, providing a theoretical overview of the project and discussing some of the results and behaviours of specific combinations.
